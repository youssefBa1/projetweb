            <h2>About My Journey</h2>
            <p>
              As a student at the Institut des Ingénieurs de la Technologie
              (IIT), I've had the opportunity to develop my technical skills and
              grow both academically and personally. Here's an honest reflection
              on my experience.
            </p>

          <div class="points-section">
            <h2>What I Like ✅</h2>
            <ul class="points-list positive">
              <li>
                <strong>Quality Education:</strong> The curriculum is
                well-structured and covers modern technologies. I've learned
                practical skills in web development, programming, and software
                engineering that are directly applicable to real-world projects.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Hands-On Projects:</strong> IIT emphasizes practical
                learning through projects and internships. This approach has
                helped me build a solid portfolio and gain confidence in
                applying theoretical knowledge to actual development work.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Supportive Professors:</strong> Most professors are
                knowledgeable and willing to help students understand complex
                concepts. Their industry experience brings valuable insights
                into the classroom.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Career Preparation:</strong> The institution provides
                internship opportunities and focuses on employability skills.
                This has helped me prepare for the professional world and
                understand industry expectations.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What Needs Improvement ⚠️</h2>
            <ul class="points-list negative">
              <li>
                <strong>Too Many Subjects Per Semester:</strong> The workload is
                overwhelming with too many subjects crammed into one semester.
                It's hard to manage everything and the schedule feels packed,
                leaving little time to properly understand each course.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Focus on Variety Instead of Mastery:</strong> The
                curriculum covers a lot of different topics superficially rather
                than going deep into any one area. I would prefer to master a
                few technologies really well instead of learning many things at
                a surface level.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Repeated Annoying Subjects:</strong> Some subjects feel
                redundant and get repeated across different semesters with
                slightly different names. It's frustrating to sit through
                similar content again when that time could be spent learning
                something new and useful.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Administrative Delays:</strong> Sometimes administrative
                processes can be slow, whether it's getting documents,
                approvals, or responses to queries. Better organization would
                help students focus more on their studies.
              </li>

            <h2>Overall Thoughts</h2>
            <p>
              Despite some challenges, my time at IIT has been valuable for my
              professional development. I've gained technical skills, completed
              meaningful projects, and built a foundation for my career. Like
              any institution, there's room for improvement, but the education
              and opportunities provided have prepared me well for the tech
              industry.
